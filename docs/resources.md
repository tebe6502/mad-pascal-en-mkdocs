### Syntax of RC files

The `RC` files are plain text files. They contain a list of resources to be included in the compiled file.
The basic syntax element looks as follows:

	RCLABEL      RCTYPE     RCFILE      [PAR0, PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, PAR4, PAR5, PAR6, PAR7]

The contents of a `RC` file may include comments, preceded by a ';' or '#' character. An example of a `RC` file:

	; this is a MPT player
	mpt_player	MPTPLAY
	
	# this is a MPT modul
	mpt_modul	MPT	'porazka.mpt'

The resource type specifies the format of the file to be included.

### Including an RC file in the application

Insert a compiler directive in the program source code (e.g., at the beginning of the implementation section):

	{$R myresources.rc}

In addition, specify in the program code the value for the `RCLABEL` labels of the corresponding resources, e.g.:

```delphi
const

    mpt_player = $8000;

    mpt_modul = $9000;
```

The inclusion of the `RC` file occurs when the program is compiled.

If the resource address points to an address under ``ROM`` (``$C000..$FFFF``) then ``ANTIC`` is disabled. At program startup, write the appropriate value to the ``DMACTL`` registry.
to turn the image back on.

### Access to Resources

Resources are placed at the indicated `RCLABEL` addresses in memory. The only exception is the `RCDATA` resource type for which it is possible to omit the `RCLABEL` definition from the program code.

In the absence of a `RCLABEL` definition, the resource is included in the compiled program, accessed via the `GetResourceHandle` routine.

	GetResourceHandle(pointer, 'rclabel');

The `GetResourceHandle` procedure sets the value of the POINTER for the resource 'RCLABEL'.
